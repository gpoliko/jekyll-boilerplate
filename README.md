# Jekyll Boilerplate
My Jekyll boilerplate for a simple blog site which I will use to document my personal learning journey, utilizing the minimal-mistakes-jekyll theme.

<br/>

**NOTE BEFORE PROCEEDING:**
> *I am still navigating **Jekyll**, the **Liquid** templating language and the **minimal-mistakes-jekyll** theme. It is highly likely that this boilerplate will be updated many times before I make a release.*
